description = "Before the Emperor arrived and absorbed the civilised world into its nation, I, the great Lord Moneybags, easily and successfully conquered my corner of the world. The ancestral home of the Blademasters stood no chance against the power of Some Ordinary Guns. And lo, after a series of demonstrative tortures and executions, I had all the workers I could possibly need to defend my castles from ingress.
Of course then the Emperor arrived and castles were replaced by laboratories, but I assume laboratories still need defending. I'm told someone will be invading soon to steal secrets, but that sounds like nonsense. The labs are underground and have no front door, and the enemies have no space machine! Are they supposed to blast through the cliff to enter? I think not."
comments = "Sometimes people just write their life story and then hide it on a secret book or server or something.
I did that once :D
I hope nobody finds it, it's very embarrassing >_< not as embarrassing as this guy and how wrong he is though."
