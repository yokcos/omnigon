name = "Secret of Mushrooms"
description = "It is known that in the far past, our forefathers saw in the distance a Great Mushroom for some days. The frenzy that ensued, to try to understand what exactly this shroom was and what it meant, incidentally brought them many scientific discoveries that we benefit from to this very day.
Our modern non-shapeshiftable Imperial Telescopes are able to see even further into the inhospitable distance, and have since revealed that this Great Mushroom was simply one of many. If you can see far enough, you can see more of these Mushrooms appear and disappear fairly regularly.
Yes, it is true: The fabled Great Mushroom was not in fact unique at all!"
comments = "What the heck? This isn't a time-travel secret! This is clearly just religious dogma focusing on these weird giant mushrooms that don't mean anything to anyone with half a brainhole. Still, no harm in stealing this secret and taking it back home."
