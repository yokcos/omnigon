name = "Basic Secret of Time Travel"
description = "It turns out that time travel is possible, in principle.
All one needs do is send exhaust or ballast through time in one direction, and the user will be sent through time in the other direction. In fact we think we've found some ballast from past time travellers... or future ones, it's hard to tell.
The question of how to actually do that though, remains a mystery."
comments = "Definitely I heard some of our bigbrain science guys talking about ballast and exhaust and that kind of thing.
I will take this secret but... I think that it is something that we already know >_<
It would be nice if they would leave a step by step tutorial on how to travel in time."
