name = "Basic Secret of Time Travel"
description = "It turns out that time travel is possible, in principle.
All one needs do is send exhaust or ballast through time in one direction, and the user will be sent through time in the other direction. In fact we think we've found some ballast from past time travellers... or future ones, it's hard to tell.
The question of how to actually do that though, remains a mystery."
comments = "I think I have heard our great nation's honourable scientists talking about this 'ballast and exhaust' business. Is this alleged secret already known to us?
I will take this secret now, and find out later if this information is new."
