description = "Moneybags, the Kingdom of Bones will soon be sending an agent called Pbot to steal your facility's secrets. For this reason we will be taking all of your more important secrets elsewhere, so they cannot be espionaged.
Pbot, if you're reading this: Please stop trying to steal our secrets. It's very annoying and it's not going to work.
Sincerely, The Emperor."
comments = "Oh noooooo. How did they know I was coming??
On the brighter side at least Moneybags has been dealt with! Guy was a nasty piece of work, happy to be rid of him.
...
I guess all that's left to do is go back home with whatever crappy secrets they left here for me to grab >_<"
