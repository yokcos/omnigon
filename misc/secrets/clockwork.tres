name = "Secret of Clockwork"
description = "A lot of our clockwork gadgetry was historically made of Browny Metal, but we all know what happened with that.
Fortunately, there is a potential replacement: Chromey Metal. Our best method of making it to take Pure Garbage and expose it to concentrated sunlight, which will turn some of it into Chromey Metal. Presumably through irradiation or something.
Now it's just a matter of reconfiguring the infrastructure to work not with Browny but Chromey clockwork, and making the Chromey generation process more efficient."
comments = "I think that this is... an actually useful secret?? :o
I've never heard of this Chromey stuff but we really need to replace a lot of Browny, it's getting all rusty and gross :("
