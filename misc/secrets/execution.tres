description = "Those who dare to research time travel open themselves up to a gruesome fate: the Time-Travel-Execution.
This is death by head explosion, carried out by an unseen adversary, along with deletion of a large chunk of their data from servers and from books.
No physical or digital barrier has even so much as lowered the chance of this happening. Even one person working alone outside of anyone else's knowledge has been slain. Even data chiselled into clay on the other side of the nation is deleted, the clay somehow returned to its pristine state.
It's got to be said, this is proving to be something of an inconvenience to this field of research."
comments = "Oh oh oh I've heard about this. Research the wrong thing and 'The Man With Two Eyes' comes to get you!
\"One eye at the beginning of time looking forward, and one eye at the end of time looking back. Between the two eyes none can escape its gaze\" is what they say :O
Sounds like a fake legend, I bet they just.. I dunno open a time portal to the head exploding universe or something!"
