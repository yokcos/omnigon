lore = "One of the first things that you learn when investigating time travel, is that you need some damn good timekeeping devices. Around here there's gears and clockwork hanging from the walls left right and centre. But I've no idea what it's all for. Wouldn't surprise me if this whole wing of the building was just a giant clock, keeping track of the time to an absurd level of precision."
